    "# Python and Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is open source, interpreted, high level language and provides great approach for object-oriented programming. It is one of the best language used by data scientist for various data science projects/application. Python provide great functionality to deal with mathematics, statistics and scientific function. It provides great libraries to deals with data science application.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main reasons why Python is widely used in the scientific and research communities is because of its ease of use and simple syntax which makes it easy to adapt for people who do not have an engineering background. It is also more suited for quick prototyping.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python was first released in 1991. It was created by Guido van Rossum as a hobby project. \n",

    "It was named after a comedy TV series.\n",

    "# Computing for Everybody\n",
    "As python was becoming popular, Van Rossum submitted a funding proposal to DARPA called \"Computer Programming for Everybody\", in which he further defined his goals for Python:\n",
    "- An easy and intuitive language just as powerful as major competitors\n",
    "- Open source, so anyone can contribute to its development\n",
    "- Code that is as understandable as plain English\n",
    "- Suitability for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times\n",
    "\n",
    "> In 2018, Python was the third most popular language on GitHub, a social coding website, behind JavaScript and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a programming language popularity survey it is consistently among the top 10 most mentioned languages in job postings. Furthermore, Python has been among the 10 most popular programming languages every year since 2004 according to the TIOBE Programming Community Index.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Zen of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 \"guiding principles\" for writing computer programs that influence the design of the Python programming language. Software engineer Tim Peters wrote this set of principles and posted it on the Python mailing list in 1999. Peters's list left open a 20th principle \"for Guido to fill in\", referring to Guido van Rossum, the original author of the Python language. The vacancy for a 20th principle has not been filled.\n",

    "## 2.4. Developing Logic Flow in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write a program, Python is just the last step. Before we start typing Python code, we need to understand how to think through a problem. Programming is not about memorizing commands — it’s about breaking a real-world task into simple steps that a computer can follow. Here’s a simple way to approach a computational problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "Problem definition is an essential initiating phase of any programming task (or even a subtask). Your goal here is not to think about Python, but rather clarify the primary requirements and ensure that you fully understand the task. You can start by asking yourself: \n",
    "    - What is the actual goal?\n",
    "    - What should happen when the program runs from beginning to end?\n",
    "    - What decision or calculation needs to happen?\n",
    "    - Is the problem asking for a single result or several steps?\n",
    "Try restating the problem in your own words. If you can't explain it, you're not ready to code yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Identify the Inputs\n",
    "A program can only work with the information it is given — it cannot assume, guess, or “fill in the blanks.”\n",
    "Identifying inputs means figuring out exactly what data the program must receive before any processing can happen. To clarify the inputs, ask yourself:\n",
    "    - What information does the program need from the user?\n",
    "    - Are there any pieces of information that come from elsewhere?\n",
    "    - What values must be given before we can calculate anything?\n",
    "    - What kind of inputs might the user enter? What are there data types? \n",
    "    - Are some inputs optional?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Identify the Output\n",
    "Think about the final result, and how will that result be finally used. In the following problems, we simply want to print the result on the screen. In more complex cases, you will have to consider whether an end user, another programm, or a database will capture and process the output. \n",
    "    - What is the final result the program must produce?\n",
    "    - Is the output a single value, multiple values, or a formatted message?\n",
    "    - Should the output be a number, text, a list, or something else?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Develop the Logic\n",
    "When you understand the problem very clearly, you are aware of its boundaries, and you have identified the inputs and the outputs, now you can come up with structured rules that a computer can follow step by step. \n",
    "    - Identify the rules involved\n",
    "    - Consider different logic flows depending on condentions\n",
    "    - Explore any limits, thresholds, exceptions, and borderline conditions\n",
    "    - Break complex logic into clear chunks in a flowchart or written in plain language"

    "A 1-dimensional array in NumPy is simply a sequence of values arranged in a single line. You can think of it like a list of numbers: reimbursements for a day, temperatures measured hourly, or the ages of employees in a department. These arrays are the simplest form of numerical data storage and are extremely common in everyday data analysis. Because they store values in a continuous block of memory and all elements share the same data type, operations like summing, averaging, or applying mathematical functions are extremely fast.\n",

    "A 2-dimensional array extends this idea into a table-like structure with rows and columns. This is the format most people are familiar with from spreadsheets or CSV files. Each row can represent an observation (e.g., one employee’s daily travel data), while each column represents a variable (e.g., distance, reimbursement amount, transport mode encoded as a number). NumPy's 2D arrays allow you to perform operations across rows or columns efficiently, making them essential for tasks like statistical summaries, matrix multiplication, filtering, and preparing data for machine learning models. This structure also lays the groundwork for linear algebra, image representation, and large-scale tabular datasets.\n",

    "A 3-dimensional array adds another axis, allowing you to stack multiple 2D arrays on top of each other.

    "CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are one of the most common formats for sharing and storing tabular data. Whether you're working with reimbursement logs, employee records, survey responses, or financial data, there is a good chance it will arrive as a CSV. In Python, the easiest and most powerful way to work with CSV files is through the Pandas library. Pandas provides a high-level interface for loading, inspecting, and manipulating data — all in a way that feels very similar to working with Excel, but much faster and more flexible.\n",

A DataFrame is a Pandas data structure that behaves like a table: it has labeled columns, indexed rows, and supports filtering, calculations, and visualizations. Once loaded, you can inspect the first few rows, view column names, check data types, or compute summaries of your dataset."
