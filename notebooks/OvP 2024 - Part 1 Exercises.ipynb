    "# Python and Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is open source, interpreted, high level language and provides great approach for object-oriented programming. It is one of the best language used by data scientist for various data science projects/application. Python provide great functionality to deal with mathematics, statistics and scientific function. It provides great libraries to deals with data science application.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main reasons why Python is widely used in the scientific and research communities is because of its ease of use and simple syntax which makes it easy to adapt for people who do not have an engineering background. It is also more suited for quick prototyping.\n",

    "\n",

    "# Computing for Everybody\n",
    "As python was becoming popular, Van Rossum submitted a funding proposal to DARPA called \"Computer Programming for Everybody\", in which he further defined his goals for Python:\n",
    "- An easy and intuitive language just as powerful as major competitors\n",
    "- Open source, so anyone can contribute to its development\n",
    "- Code that is as understandable as plain English\n",
    "- Suitability for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times\n",
    "\n",
    "> In 2018, Python was the third most popular language on GitHub, a social coding website, behind JavaScript and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a programming language popularity survey it is consistently among the top 10 most mentioned languages in job postings. Furthermore, Python has been among the 10 most popular programming languages every year since 2004 according to the TIOBE Programming Community Index.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Zen of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 \"guiding principles\" for writing computer programs that influence the design of the Python programming language. Software engineer Tim Peters wrote this set of principles and posted it on the Python mailing list in 1999. Peters's list left open a 20th principle \"for Guido to fill in\", referring to Guido van Rossum, the original author of the Python language. The vacancy for a 20th principle has not been filled.\n",

It provides a convenient API for sending HTTP/1.1 requests, handling response content, and managing various aspects of HTTP communication. The module is widely used for interacting with web APIs and fetching data from the internet. Its simplicity and readability make it a popular choice for HTTP-related tasks. \n",

In the background, the `requests` module abstracts the complexities of building and sending HTTP requests, managing sessions, and handling cookies.\n",

    "Univariate analysis is the simplest form of data analysis where the data being analyzed contains only one variable. Since it's a single variable it doesn’t deal with causes or relationships.  The main purpose of univariate analysis is to describe the data and find patterns that exist within it.\n",

    "You can think of the variable as a category that your data falls into. One example of a variable in univariate analysis might be \"age\". Another might be \"height\". Univariate analysis would not look at these two variables at the same time, nor would it look at the relationship between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some ways you can describe patterns found in univariate data include looking at mean, mode, median, range, variance, maximum, minimum, quartiles, and standard deviation. Additionally, some ways you may display univariate data include frequency distribution tables, bar charts, histograms, frequency polygons, and pie charts.\n",

    "Bivariate analysis is used to find out if there is a relationship between two different variables. Something as simple as creating a scatterplot by plotting one variable against another on a Cartesian plane (think X and Y axis) can sometimes give you a picture of what the data is trying to tell you. If the data seems to fit a line or curve then there is a relationship or correlation between the two variables.  For example, one might choose to plot caloric intake versus weight.\n",

    "Classical statistics focused almost exclusively on inference, a sometimes complex set of procedures for drawing conclusions about large populations based on small samples. In 1962, John W. Tukey called for a reformation of statistics in his seminal paper “The Future of Data Analysis”. He proposed a new scientific discipline called data analysis that included statistical inference as just one component. Tukey forged links to the engineering and computer science communities (he coined the terms bit, short for binary digit, and software), and his original tenets are suprisingly durable and form part of the foundation for data science. The field of exploratory data analysis was established with Tukey’s 1977 now-classic book Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
