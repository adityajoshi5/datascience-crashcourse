Something as simple as creating a scatterplot by plotting one variable against another on a Cartesian plane (think X and Y axis) can sometimes give you a picture of what the data is trying to tell you.

He proposed a new scientific discipline called data analysis that included statistical inference as just one component. Tukey forged links to the engineering and computer science communities (he coined the terms bit, short for binary digit, and software), and his original tenets are suprisingly durable and form part of the foundation for data science. The field of exploratory data analysis was established with Tukey’s 1977 now-classic book Exploratory Data Analysis\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why Pandas?\n",
    "- Fast and efficient DataFrame object with default and customized indexing.\n",
    "- Tools for loading data into in-memory data objects from different file formats.\n",
    "- Data alignment and integrated handling of missing data.\n",
    "- Reshaping and pivoting of date sets.\n",
    "- Label-based slicing, indexing and subsetting of large data sets.\n",
    "- Columns from a data structure can be deleted or inserted.\n",
    "- Group by data for aggregation and transformations.\n",
    "- High performance merging and joining of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Format Support\n",
    "Pandas supports the integration with many file formats or data sources out of the box (csv, excel, sql, json, parquet,…). Importing data from each of these data sources is provided by function with the prefix `read_*`. Similarly, the `to_*` methods are used to store data.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis and Visualization\n",
    "Basic statistics (mean, median, min, max, counts…) are easily calculable. These or custom aggregations can be applied on the entire data set, a sliding window of the data or grouped by categories. The latter is also known as the split-apply-combine approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas provides plotting your data out of the box, using the power of Matplotlib. You can pick the plot type (scatter, bar, boxplot,…) corresponding to your data.\n",

They are particularly adept at showing interactions: how the relationship between levels of one categorical variable changes across levels of a second categorical variable. The lines that join each point from the same hue level allow interactions to be judged by differences in slope, which is easier for the eyes than comparing the heights of several groups of points or bars."
